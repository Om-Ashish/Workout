                    Exercise Boosts Brainpower
                    <p>

                        Not only does exercise improve your body, it helps your mental function, says certified trainer
                        David
                        Atkinson.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "Exercise increases energy levels and increases serotonin in the brain, which leads to improved
                        mental
                        clarity," says Atkinson, director of program development for Cooper Ventures, a division of the
                        Cooper
                        Aerobics Center in Dallas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        All that makes for a more productive day.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "It is clear that those who are active and who exercise are much more productive at work," says
                        Todd A.
                        Astorino, assistant professor of kinesiology at California State University-San Marcos.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Improved productivity not only makes you a better worker, it makes things better for everyone in
                        the
                        workplace. Companies with less wasted work hours and less sick time end up with lower health
                        care costs --
                        and an improved bottom line, Astorino says.

                    Movement Melts Away Stress
                    <p>
                        As much as it may stress you out just to think about exercising, once you actually start working
                        out, you'll experience less stress in every part of your life.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "Exercise produces a relaxation response that serves as a positive distraction," says Cedric
                        Bryant, chief exercise physiologist for the American Council on Exercise. He says it also helps
                        elevate your mood and keep depression at bay.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You're not the only person who will benefit from more happiness and less stress in your life.
                        When you're less stressed, you're less irritable, Atkinson says -- and that could improve
                        relationships with your partner, kids, and co-workers.

                    Exercise Gives You Energy
                    <p>
                        You might be surprised at how, say, popping in a workout tape for 30 minutes in the morning can
                        change your whole day. When endorphins are released into your bloodstream during exercise, says
                        Astorino, "you feel much more energized the rest of the day."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And when you improve your strength and stamina, it's easier to accomplish everyday tasks like
                        carrying groceries and climbing stairs. This also helps you feel more energetic over the course
                        of the day.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A common excuse among Atkinson's clients is that they're too tired to exercise, he says. While
                        exercise may make you feel more tired at first, he says, that won't last long.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The physical tiredness you feel after working out isn't the same as everyday fatigue, he says.
                        Besides, once your body adjusts to exercise, you'll have more energy than ever.
