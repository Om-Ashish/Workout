            <hr>
            <h2>Exercises are generally grouped into three types depending on the overall effect they have on the human
                body : </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Aerobic exercises, such as cycling, walking, running, hiking, and playing tennis, focus on
                    increasing
                    cardiovascular endurance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Anaerobic exercises, such as weight training, increase short-term muscle strength.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Flexibility exercises such as stretching improve the range of motion of muscles and joints.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Aerobic vs Anaerobic</h3>
            <p>
                Frequent and regular aerobic exercise has been shown to help prevent or treat serious and
                life-threatening
                chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, insomnia, and
                depression. Strength training appears to have continuous energy-burning effects that persist for about
                24
                hours after the training, though they do not offer the same cardiovascular benefits of aerobic
                exercises.
                Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise also work to increase the mechanical efficiency of the heart by
                increasing cardiac volume (aerobic exercise), or myocardial thickness (strength training).
                <br>
                <br>
                When generalized fitness is a professional operational requirement, as for athletes, combat services,
                police
                and fire personnel, aerobic exercise alone may not provide a well-balanced exercise program. In
                particular,
                muscular strength, especially upper-body muscular strength, is usually neglected. Also, the metabolic
                pathways involved in anaerobic metabolism (glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation) that generate energy
                during high intensity, low duration tasks such as sprinting, are not exercised at peak rates. Aerobic
                exercise is, however, an extremely valuable component of a balanced exercise program and is good for
                cardiovascular health.
                <br>
                <br>
                Aerobics notably does not increase the basal metabolic rate as much as some forms of weight-training,
                and
                may therefore be less effective at reducing obesity. However, this form of exercise also allows for
                longer,
                more frequent activity and consumes more energy when the individual is active. In addition, the
                metabolic
                activity of an individual is heightened for several hours following a bout of aerobic activity.
                <br>
                <br>
                Not everyone benefits equally from the different types of exercise . There is tremendous variation in
                individual response to exercise: where most people will see a moderate increase in endurance from
                aerobic
                exercise, some individuals will as much as double their oxygen uptake, while others will never get any
                benefit at all from the exercise.7 Similarly, only a minority of people will show significant muscle
                growth
                after prolonged weight training, while a larger fraction experience improvements in strength.8 This is
                why
                people should experiment and try different types of physical activity, so that they can find what type
                they
                really like and what works for them.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The bottom line when undertaking an aerobic or an anaerobic exercise program is that you must be careful
                and responsible. Both may provide the type of vigorous workout that you require. So listen to your body
                and exercise your common sense as well as your muscles.
                <br>
                <br>
                Suddenly going from being completely sedentary to rushing out for a four mile jog or being forced to do
                a school sport that you loathed would be enough to put anyone off. Yet if you find a form of activity
                that suits your body and take it at the right pace, far from hurting, working up a sweat stimulates the
                release of chemicals in the body that make you feel good. But before you head for the treadmill or put
                on your trainers for a run round the park, read on, because the benefits of regular exercise don't end
                there.
